## ðŸ“Œ Description
This was developed as part of my internship in **Numerical Analysis**.  
The main objective is to investigate phenomena related to **round-off errors** and **numerical conditioning**, particularly in arithmetic operations.  
The work focuses on:
- The impact of summation order on result accuracy.
- The study of numerical problem conditioning.
- Simulation of rounding errors .
- Probabilistic and deterministic analysis of error propagation.
